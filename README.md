## Dataset Introduction:  

**Customer Personality Analysis** is a detailed analysis of a company’s ideal customers. It helps a business to better understand its customers and makes it easier for them to modify products according to the specific needs, behaviors and concerns of different types of customers.

**Customer personality analysis** helps a business to modify its product based on its target customers from different types of customer segments. For example, instead of spending money to market a new product to every customer in the company’s database, a company can analyze which customer segment is most likely to buy the product and then market the product only on that particular segment.

## Problem Statements:  

The company wants to **modify its products based on its target customers from various types of customer segments**. Instead of spending money marketing a new product to all customers, market your product to customers who are likely to buy it. For that we must be able to understand the shopping habits of customers based on their characteristics.
